# Lastik
A slingshot game programmed in C.
## How does it work?
###### From the menu, you can configure the game to change your projectile type (plastic, wood, or iron), change your wind speed, and show the current configuration.
###### By default, the game is configured to wood ammo type and light wind speed. The heavier the projectile, the lesser it is affected by wind speed.
## How to play?
###### From the main menu, enter 2 and the game will prompt the location of the targets each round.
###### The slingshot is from origin point (0,0). Your objective is to hit the location of the targets three times. The fastest to hit all three targets wins.
## Known Issues
###### I didn't implement the file system correctly, i.e., the user scores are not saved in the userScores.txt file properly. Will I fix it? Maybeeeeeeeeeee. ðŸ‘€ (If someone asks me too heh heh)
